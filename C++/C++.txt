--> What is C++?
    ------------

C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language(OOP).
It's also known as Structural Programming Language.

--> Features of C++:-
    ---------------

* Array                               * Inheritance
* Sructure                            * Polymorphism
* Class and Object                    * Encapsulation
* Constuctor and Destructure          * Quere and Linked list
* Containership Sorting

--> Function:-
    --------

1. User Define Function
   Those Functions which have body. 

   Example: int main()
            {
               //code
            }

2. Pre Define Function
   Those Functions which ended by semicolon.

   Example: printf( );

--> Program Debugging:-
    -----------------

After writing a program the next step is to debug the program.
Debugging means Solving the errors and faults.

ERROR:

1.Syntax Error  
2.Runtime Error  
3.Logical Error
