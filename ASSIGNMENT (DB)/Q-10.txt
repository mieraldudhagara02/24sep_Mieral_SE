Q-10. What is Trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?

-->   A Trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs
      when an event occurs in the database server.

- CREATING TRIGGER:-
  ----------------

-> create trigger [trigger_name] [before | after] {insert | update | delete} on [table_name]
   [for each row] [trigger_body]

-->  EXPLANATION OF SYNTAX:-
     ---------------------

- Create trigger [trigger_name]: Creates or replaces an existing trigger with the trigger_name.

- [before | after]: This specifies when the trigger will be executed.

- {insert | update | delete}: This specifies the DML operation.

- on [table_name]: This specifies the name of the table associated with the trigger.

- [for each row]: This specifies a row-level trigger, i.e., the trigger will be executed
  for each row being affected.

- [trigger_body]: This provides the operation to be performed as trigger is fired.

- BEFORE Triggers run the Trigger action before the triggering statement is run.
- AFTER Triggers run the Trigger action after the triggering statement is run.
