Q-8. What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints.


-->  SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.

==>  The available constraints in SQL are:
        
        * Primary Key
        * Foreign Key
        * Unique Key

* PRIMARY KEY:-

- A Primary Key is a column of table which uniquely identifies each tuple in that table.

- Only one Primary Key is allowed to used in a table.

- The Primary Key does not accept the any duplicate and NULL values.


* FOREIGN KEY:-

- A Foreign Key is a field which can uniquely identify each row in a another table.

- And this constraint is used to specify a field as Foreign Key.

* UNIQUE KEY:-

- This constraint when specified with a column, tells that all the values in the column
  must be unique. 

- That is, the values in any row of a column must not be repeated.
