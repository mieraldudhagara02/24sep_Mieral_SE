Q-5. What do you understand by Data Redundancy?

-->  Data Redundancy occurs when the same piece of data exists in multiple places.
     
-->  Data Redundancy occurs when the same data point is multiplied across the database
     and can be found repeated in an unnecessary form.

-->  The Redundant data can be either a whole copy of the original data or selected
     pieces of data.

-->  Data Redundancy helps protect data. When data cannot be accessed, redundant data 
     can help replace or rebuild missing data.
